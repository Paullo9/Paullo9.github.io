In 4D-STEM, a convergent electron beam is scanned across a sample, and a complete 2D electron diffraction pattern is recorded for each probe position. This generates a 4-dimensional dataset enabling sophisticated material analysis, such as virtual dark and bright-field imaging, crystal orientation analysis, and strain mapping.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1},"end":{"line":4,"column":1}},"key":"gKTQEaXuMr"}],"key":"HokigtNDCh"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1},"end":{"line":6,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Handling and processing these extensive datasets, often several hundred gigabytes in size, is a complex task.
