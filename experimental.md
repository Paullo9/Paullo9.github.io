# Experimental setup and measurement Instumentation
- Which TEM, which camera, microdiffraction mode etc.
- tikz image of the setup

# High-pressure torsion (HPT) specimen

- describe manufacturing; pressured, rotated, annealed etc.
- talk to HW about the properties and preparation using FIB
- why HPT? graph? fine grain structure etc.
- What is interesting about this sample? How can 4D-STEM help understand its properties?


# boron-doped diamond on graphene
- describe its manufacturing, thank LOT
- used as a proxy, dataset was already available, meassured by CO
- What is interesting about this sample? How can 4D-STEM help understand its properties?
