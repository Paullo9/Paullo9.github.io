# Description
The sample was provided by HW and consists of 65 at.% Ni + 35 at.% Cu. It was manufactured using [[high-pressure torsion]] in Japan. The sample underwent homogenization via hot isostatic pressing at 1200°C for 5 hours, followed by helium quenching to room temperature. For thermo-mechanical treatment, high-pressure torsion was applied at 5 GPa, 5 rpm, with 10 full turns. Subsequently, parts of the sample underwent low-temperature annealing at 300°C for 4 weeks.
The focused ion beam (FIB) thinning was also performed by HW at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB). Three lamellas where prepared, position B,C, and D on a omni grid. Lamella C was prepared after HPT treatment, Lamella B and D after an additional low-temperature annealing.

## Possible direction of investigation
It is of interest wether the strain distribution varies between the center and the edge of the sample. Additionally we hope to see a noticeable difference in strain distribution between the sample that has undergone high-pressure torsion (HPT) and the one that has undergone both HPT and annealing.
