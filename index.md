## Welcome

Welcome to the website for my masterâ€™s thesis on 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), an advanced technique in transmission electron microscopy setup. In 4D-STEM, a convergent electron beam is scanned across a sample, and a complete 2D electron diffraction pattern is recorded for each probe position. This generates a 4-dimensional dataset enabling sophisticated material analysis, such as virtual dark and bright-field imaging, crystal orientation analysis, and strain mapping.

Handling and processing these extensive datasets, often several hundred gigabytes in size, is a complex task. To manage this, we will utilize the OMNI Computing Cluster (HPC) at the University of Siegen. To transform the data into into interpretable formats we will be using the py4DSTEM library, it supports diverse modes of 4D-STEM analysis for both traditional and advanced imaging techniques.

This website will document the setup of the computational environment, literature reviews, and progress updates related to my thesis. The primary files associated with my thesis will be maintained/compiled on Overleaf, while my GitHub repository will serve as the version control system for the Latex files (.tex) and the Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), which integrate python code and markdown for clarity and ease of collaboration.
