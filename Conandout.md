title: Conclusion and Outlook

---

# Orientation and strain of HPT
# Data analysis and challenges
# 4D-STEM at usi
- better detectors, intelligent detectors? Write only what you want to read later?
- data management, INCYTE?
- 4D-STEM together with EDX
- 4D-STEM + tomography?
- direct electron detectors, faster network connections, glasfiber etc.
- compute on GPU with paralleization/acceleration with CUDA
- Try with lower doses with soft materials, e.g polymers, biological samples, maybe in combination with cryo
