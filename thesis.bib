	abstract = {Unsupervised machine learning techniques have been combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) to enable comprehensive crystal structure analysis with nanometer spatial resolution. In this study, we investigated large-scale data obtained by four-dimensional (4D) {STEM} using dimensionality reduction techniques such as non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}) and hierarchical clustering with various optimization methods. We developed software scripts incorporating knowledge of electron diffraction and {STEM} imaging for data preprocessing, {NMF}, and hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering was performed using cross-correlation instead of conventional Euclidean distances, resulting in rotation-corrected diffractions and shift-corrected maps of major components. An experimental analysis was conducted on a high-pressure-annealed metallic glass, Zr-Cu-Al, revealing an amorphous matrix and crystalline precipitates with an average diameter of approximately 7 nm, which were challenging to detect using conventional {STEM} techniques. Combining 4D-{STEM} and optimized unsupervised machine learning enables comprehensive bimodal (i.e., spatial and reciprocal) analyses of material nanostructures.},

Measurements were taken of the microhardness values both along diameters in each disk and following a rectilinear grid pattern to give color-coded maps of the hardness distributions. The results show the hardness increases by a factor of ∼2 in the first turn of {HPT} but the microhardness distribution is inhomogeneous because higher values of hardness are recorded in the central regions of the disks. This central region of inhomogeneity decreases with increasing numbers of turns so that the hardness distribution becomes essentially homogeneous after five turns. The results are different from earlier reports in {HPT} where the central regions of the disks have a lower hardness. The results are interpreted using a model in which the degree of hardness depends upon the rate of recovery in the material.},

	abstract = {The technique known as 4D-{STEM} has recently emerged as a powerful tool for the local characterization of crystalline structures in materials, such as cathode materials for Li-ion batteries or perovskite materials for photovoltaics. However, the use of new detectors optimized for electron diffraction patterns and other advanced techniques requires constant adaptation of methodologies to address the challenges associated with crystalline materials. In this study, we present a novel image-processing method to improve pattern matching in the determination of crystalline orientations and phases. Our approach uses sub-pixel adaptive image processing to register and reconstruct electron diffraction signals in large 4D-{STEM} datasets. By using adaptive prominence and linear filters, we can improve the quality of the diffraction pattern registration. The resulting data compression rate of 103 is well-suited for the era of big data and provides a significant enhancement in the performance of the entire {ACOM} data processing method. Our approach is evaluated using dedicated metrics, which demonstrate a high improvement in phase recognition. Several features are extracted from the registered data to map properties such as the spot count, and various virtual dark fields, which are used to enhance the handling of the results maps. Our results demonstrate that this data preparation method not only enhances the quality of the resulting image but also boosts the confidence level in the analysis of the outcomes related to determining crystal orientation and phase. Additionally, it mitigates the impact of user bias that may occur during the application of the method through the manipulation of parameters.},

	abstract = {Nanoscale strain mapping by four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-{STEM}) relies on determining the precise locations of Bragg-scattered electrons in a sequence of diffraction patterns, a task which is complicated by dynamical scattering, inelastic scattering, and shot noise. These features hinder accurate automated computational detection and position measurement of the diffracted disks, limiting the precision of measurements of local deformation. Here, we investigate the use of patterned probes to improve the precision of strain mapping. We imprint a “bullseye” pattern onto the probe, by using a binary mask in the probe-forming aperture, to improve the robustness of the peak finding algorithm to intensity modulations inside the diffracted disks. We show that this imprinting leads to substantially improved strain-mapping precision at the expense of a slight decrease in spatial resolution. In experiments on an unstrained silicon reference sample, we observe an improvement in strain measurement precision from 2.7\% of the reciprocal lattice vectors with standard probes to 0.3\% using bullseye probes for a thin sample, and an improvement from 4.7\% to 0.8\% for a thick sample. We also use multislice simulations to explore how sample thickness and electron dose limit the attainable accuracy and precision for 4D-{STEM} strain measurements.},

The effects of counting noise in a digital data-collection system are studied, together with various sources of systematic error. The sensitivity of parts of the pattern to specific structure-factor parameters is analysed via the calculation of analytic gradients of the intensity with respect to those parameters. All calculations are based on diffraction at the [110] axis of {GaP}, using simulated {CBED} patterns as idealesed “experimental” data.

	abstract = {A new method to re®ne crystal structural parameters using convergent-beam electron diffraction ({CBED}), which is applicable to nanometre-size crystal structure analysis, is proposed. This method is based on the ®tting between theoretical calculations and experimental intensities of energy-®ltered two-dimensional {CBED} patterns containing higher-order Laue-zone ({HOLZ}) re¯ections. The use of {HOLZ} re¯ections is essential for the method because small displacements of atoms can be sensitively detected using {HOLZ} re¯ections with large reciprocal vectors. For this purpose, a new  -®lter transmission microscope ({JEM}-2010FEF), which can take energy-®ltered {CBED} patterns up to a high angle with a small distortion, and a new analysis program to re®ne structural parameters, which is based on manybeam Bloch-wave calculations and nonlinear leastsquares ®tting, have been developed. As a test example, a positional parameter and isotropic and anisotropic Debye±Waller factors of {CdS} have been re®ned. Twodimensional {CBED} patterns calculated with the re®ned parameters show very good agreement with the experimental ones, and the re®ned values of the parameters also agree well with the result of a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. Important problems of the analysis procedure are discussed item by item.},

	abstract = {While aberration correction for scanning transmission electron microscopes ({STEMs}) dramatically increased the spatial resolution obtainable in the images of materials that are stable under the electron beam, the practical resolution of many {STEM} images is now limited by the sample stability rather than the microscope. To extract physical information from the images of beam sensitive materials, it is becoming clear that there is a critical dose/dose-rate below which the images can be interpreted as representative of the pristine material, while above it the observation is dominated by beam effects. Here, we describe an experimental approach for sparse sampling in the {STEM} and in-painting image reconstruction in order to reduce the electron dose/dose-rate to the sample during imaging. By characterizing the induction limited rise-time and hysteresis in the scan coils, we show that a sparse line-hopping approach to scan randomization can be implemented that optimizes both the speed of the scan and the amount of the sample that needs to be illuminated by the beam. The dose and acquisition time for the sparse sampling is shown to be effectively decreased by at least a factor of 5× relative to conventional acquisition, permitting imaging of beam sensitive materials to be obtained without changing the microscope operating parameters. The use of sparse line-hopping scan to acquire {STEM} images is demonstrated with atomic resolution aberration corrected the Z-contrast images of {CaCO}3, a material that is traditionally difficult to image by {TEM}/{STEM} because of dosage issues.},

	abstract = {Scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) provides structural analysis with sub-angstrom resolution. But the pixel-by-pixel scanning process is a limiting factor in acquiring high-speed data. Different strategies have been implemented to increase scanning speeds while at the same time minimizing beam damage via optimizing the scanning strategy. Here, we achieve the highest possible scanning speed by eliminating the image acquisition dead time induced by the beam flyback time combined with reducing the amount of scanning pixels via sparse imaging. A calibration procedure was developed to compensate for the hysteresis of the magnetic scan coils. A combination of sparse and serpentine scanning routines was tested for a crystalline thin film, gold nanoparticles, and in an in-situ liquid phase {STEM} experiment. Frame rates of 92, 23 and 5.8 s-1 were achieved for images of a width of 128, 256, and 512 pixels, respectively. The methods described here can be applied to single-particle tracking and analysis of radiation sensitive materials.},

Once measured, {PSFs} can be used with two or more low-resolution images of a selected area to create a high-resolution reconstructed image of that area. As an example, a 4× improvement in resolution for images is demonstrated for a fine gold particle sample. Since thermionic source instruments have high beam currents associated with large probe sizes, use of this approach implies that high-resolution images can be produced rapidly if the probe diameter is less of a limiting factor. Additionally, very accurate determination of the {PSFs} can lead to a better understanding of instrument performance as exemplified by very accurate measurement of the beam shape and therefore the degree of astigmatism.},

	isbn = {978-1-4419-7199-9},
	abstract = {This chapter describes electron nanodiffraction and its use for structural imaging and analysis. The chapter is organized into five sections. The first section contains an introduction to electron nanodiffraction and diffraction imaging and the motivations for developing these techniques. Section 9.2 covers different electron nanodiffraction techniques and their implementation. It is followed by a discussion on the information that can be obtained from electron nanodiffraction and the theory behind it. In outlining the theory for electron nanodiffraction in Section 9.3, we first rely on the kinematical theory to give a conceptual foundation for electron nanodiffraction. The treatment of the kinematical theory is then followed by the well-developed electron multiple scattering theory for {CBED} of medium to thick crystals. The kinematical theory can be used for both crystalline and noncrystalline atomic structures, while the theory for {CBED} is largely limited to crystals or crystals with certain types of defects. For the treatment of electron multiple scattering of arbitrary structures, we included a description of the multi-slice method, which is a numerical method often used for electron diffraction simulations. The description of the electron nanodiffraction techniques in Section 9.2 and theory in Section 9.3 are followed by a few application examples in Section 9.4. We focus on the applications of {SEND} for imaging strain, nanostructures, and defects. The application examples given here serve to highlight the potential of {SEND} rather than a complete review of electron nanodiffraction applications. We also provide the experimental details in Section 9.4 to give some ideas of what it takes to do {SEND}. The chapter is finished with a conclusion.},

The in-pixel circuitry provides a 1,000,000:1 dynamic range within a single frame, allowing the direct electron beam to be imaged while still maintaining single electron sensitivity. A 1.1 {kHz} framing rate enables rapid data collection and minimizes sample drift distortions while scanning. By capturing the entire unsaturated diffraction pattern in scanning mode, one can simultaneously capture bright field, dark field, and phase contrast information, as well as being able to analyze the full scattering distribution, allowing true center of mass imaging. The scattering is recorded on an absolute scale, so that information such as local sample thickness can be directly determined.

We provide an algorithm to determine the orientation of each diffraction pattern based on a fast sparse correlation method. We demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method by indexing diffraction patterns generated using both kinematical and dynamical simulations. We have also measured orientation maps from an experimental dataset consisting of a complex polycrystalline twisted helical {AuAgPd} nanowire. From these maps we identify twin planes between adjacent grains, which may be responsible for the twisted helical structure.

The experimental beam intensity distribution is measured from an energy filtered {CBED} pattern recorded on a {CCD} camera. The calculated profile is based on dynamical diffraction theory, and with the two-beam approximation the analytical expression contains only two free parameters: specimen thickness t and extinction distance ξg. Parameter refinement through minimization of the difference between experimental and calculated intensity profiles is carried out using Origin™ 5.0 software from Microcal. The iterative procedure always converges to a unique solution in a few seconds, yielding an accurate value for both thickness and extinction distance. The method is extensively tested on silicon using the (004) Bragg reflection. On specimens in the usual {TEM} thickness range, the method gives result similar to the conventional (P.M.

A statistical comparison of our method with the Kelly and Allen techniques, based on more than 50 experiments, shows an improvement in measured extinction distance dispersion. Using 197keV electrons, and liquid-nitrogen cryo-holder, the new technique yields an experimental value of 161±3nm for the extinction distance for silicon with the (004) Bragg reflection. The equivalent tabulated value at 0K is about 156nm. Using the Kelly and Allen methods, the extinction distance is found to be 162±6nm. The improvement in precision is a direct consequence of matching the intensity profile envelope, which contains information on the extinction distance. Also the accuracy of thickness determination is improved and is around 0.5 to 1\% for common specimen thickness. The minimum measurable sample thickness is shown to be two to three times thinner than with the Kelly and Allen methods (0.3ξg as opposed to 0.8ξg).

The high pressure torsion straining ({HPT}) process, which involves large shear and compressive plastic deformation, has been the subject of intensive study in recent years due to its capability of producing fully dense samples having an ultrafine grain size. Because the evolution of the microstructures and mechanical properties of plastically deformed materials are directly related to the amount of plastic deformation, the understanding of the phenomenon associated with the strain development is very important. In this process, knowledge of the internal stress and strain distribution is fundamental to the determination of the optimum process conditions for a given material, such as the number of rotations, the rotational speed and the temperature. In this study, the commercial elasto-plastic finite element method ({ABAQUS}) is applied to obtain a better understanding of the plastic deformation behaviour of the workpiece during the torsion straining process. The simulated geometry (thickness distribution) of the workpiece is compared with previous experiment data obtained using copper specimens with different number of rotations. The thickness of the workpiece decreased with distance from the centre because of the higher compressive plastic stress state in the centre region compared to the outer part during the loading stage and the elastic recovery during unloading.},

Compared to other {STEM} phase contrast modes including annular bright field ({ABF}) and differential phase contrast ({DPC}), we show that the ptychographic phase reconstruction method using pixelated detectors offers the highest contrast transfer efficiency and superior low dose performance. Applying the ptychographic reconstruction method to {DPC} segmented detectors also improves the detector contrast transfer and results in less noisy images than {DPC} images formed using difference signals.

	abstract = {Disordered structures producing a non-iridescent color impression have been shown to feature a spherically shaped Fourier transform of their refractive-index distribution. We determine the direction and efficiency of scattering from thin films made from such structures with the help of the Ewald sphere construction which follows from first-order scattering approximation. This way we present a simple geometrical argument why these structures are well suited for creating short wavelength colors like blue but are hindered from producing long wavelength colors like red. We also numerically synthesize a model structure dedicated to produce a sharp spherical shell in reciprocal space. The reflectivity of this structure as predicted by the first-order approximation is compared to direct electromagnetic simulations. The results indicate the Ewald sphere construction to constitute a simple geometrical tool that can be used to describe and to explain important spectral and directional features of the reflectivity. It is shown that total internal reflection in the film in combination with directed scattering can be used to obtain long wavelength structural colors.},

Here we investigate and compare three different scan patterns, making use of a programmable scan engine that allows to arbitrarily set the sequence of probe positions that are consecutively visited on the sample. We compare the typical raster scan with a so-called ‘snake’ pattern where the scan direction is reversed after each row and a novel Hilbert scan pattern that changes scan direction rapidly and provides an homogeneous treatment of both scan directions. We experimentally evaluate the imaging performance on a single crystal test sample by varying dwell time and evaluating behaviour with respect to sample drift. We demonstrate the ability of the Hilbert scan pattern to more faithfully represent the high frequency content of the image in the presence of sample drift. It is also shown that Hilbert scanning provides reduced bias when measuring lattice parameters from the obtained scanned images while maintaining similar precision in both scan directions which is especially important when e.g. performing strain analysis. Compared to raster scanning with flyback correction, both snake and Hilbert scanning benefit from dose reduction as only small probe movement steps occur.},

	abstract = {Scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) has emerged as one of the foremost techniques to analyze materials at atomic resolution. However, two practical difficulties inherent to {STEM} imaging are: radiation damage imparted by the electron beam, which can potentially damage or otherwise modify the specimen and slow-scan image acquisition, which limits the ability to capture dynamic changes at high temporal resolution. Furthermore, due in part to scan flyback corrections, typical raster scan methods result in an uneven distribution of dose across the scanned area. A method to allow extremely fast scanning with a uniform residence time would enable imaging at low electron doses, ameliorating radiation damage and at the same time permitting image acquisition at higher frame-rates while maintaining atomic resolution. The practical complication is that rastering the {STEM} probe at higher speeds causes significant image distortions. Non-square scan patterns provide a solution to this dilemma and can be tailored for low dose imaging conditions. Here, we develop a method for imaging with alternative scan patterns and investigate their performance at very high scan speeds. A general analysis for spiral scanning is presented here for the following spiral scan functions: Archimedean, Fermat, and constant linear velocity spirals, which were tested for {STEM} imaging. The quality of spiral scan {STEM} images is generally comparable with {STEM} images from conventional raster scans, and the dose uniformity can be improved.},

	abstract = {In conclusion, this chapter describes the practice and theory of electron diffraction for structural analysis of crystals and nanomaterials. It is demonstrated that the information obtainable from electron diffraction with a small probe and the strong electron interactions complements with other characterization techniques, such as X-ray and neutron diffraction that typically samples a large volume and real space imaging by {HREM} with a limited resolution. The recent developments in electron energy-filtering, 2-D digital detectors and computer-based image analysis and simulations have significant improved the quantification of electron diffraction. Examples were given to demonstrate the resolution and sensitivity of electron diffraction to individual nanostructures and to highlight the remarkable achievement in the improvement of accuracy of electron diffraction and the application for crystal charge density mapping.
The future for electron nanocrystallography is very bright for two reasons. First, electron diffraction pattern can be recorded selectively from individual nanostructure at sizes as small as a nanometer using electron probe forming lenses and apertures, while electron imaging provides the selectivity. Secondly, electrons interact with matter much more strongly than X-ray and Neutron diffraction. These advantages, coupled with quantitative analysis, enable the structure determination of small, nonperiodic, structures that was not possible before.},

The recent development of electron-sensitive and pixelated detectors has attracted the use of four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-{STEM}). Here, we present a precession electron diffraction-assisted 4D-{STEM} technique for automated orientation mapping using diffraction spot patterns directly captured by an in-column scintillator-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor ({CMOS}) detector. We compare the results to a conventional approach, which utilizes a fluorescent screen filmed by an external charge charge-coupled device camera. The high-dynamic range and signal-to-noise characteristics of the detector greatly improve the image quality of the diffraction patterns, especially the visibility of diffraction spots at high scattering angles. In the orientation maps reconstructed via the template matching process, the {CMOS} data yield a significant reduction of false indexing and higher reliability compared to the conventional approach. The angular resolution of misorientation measurement could also be improved by masking reflections close to the direct beam. This is because the orientation sensitive, weak, and small diffraction spots at high scattering angles are more significant. The results show that fine details, such as nanograins, nanotwins, and sub-grain boundaries, can be resolved with a sub-degree angular resolution which is comparable to orientation mapping using Kikuchi diffraction patterns.},

	abstract = {Simulation of transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) images or diffraction patterns is often required to interpret experimental data. Since nuclear cores dominate electron scattering, the scattering potential is typically described using an independent atom model, which completely neglects valence bonding and its effect on the transmitting electrons. As instrumentation has advanced, new measurements have revealed subtle details of the scattering potential that were previously not accessible to experiment. We have created an open-source simulation code designed to meet these demands by integrating the ability to calculate the potential via density functional theory ({DFT}) with a flexible modular software design. {abTEM} can simulate most standard imaging modes and incorporates the latest algorithmic developments. The development of new techniques requires a program that is accessible to domain experts without extensive programming experience. {abTEM} is written purely in Python and designed for easy modification and extension. The effective use of modern open-source libraries makes our performance highly competitive with existing optimized codes on both {CPUs} and {GPUs}. {abTEM} is designed to work in an interactive Python notebook, allowing us to leverage an extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as the Atomic Simulation Environment and the {DFT} code {GPAW}. This creates a seamless and reproducible workflow from defining an atomic structure, calculating molecular dynamics ({MD}) and electrostatic potentials, to the analysis of results, all in a single, easy-to-read document. This article provides ongoing documentation of {abTEM} development. In this first version, we show use cases for hexagonal boron nitride, where valence bonding can be detected, a 4D-{STEM} simulation of molybdenum disulfide including ptychographic phase reconstruction, a comparison of {MD} and frozen phonon modeling for convergent-beam electron diffraction of a 2.6-million-atom silicon system, and a performance comparison of our fast {PRISM} algorithm for a decahedral 20000-atom gold nanoparticle.},

The {DMD}, in effect, takes the place of the objective aperture in a transmission electron microscope ({TEM}) or an annular detector in a scanning transmission electron microscope ({STEM}), but has the distinct advantage that it can be programmed to take any shape in real time. Proof-of-principle data collected with the detector show diffraction contrast in samples ranging from a polycrystalline gold film to monolayer graphene.},

The precipitate crystal structures were assessed by scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with a novel scanning precession electron diffraction approach, which includes machine learning. The combination of techniques enabled evaluation of the atomic arrangement within individual precipitates, as well as an improved estimate of precipitate phase fractions at each ageing condition, through analysis of a statistically significant number of precipitates. Based on the obtained results, the total amount of solute atoms locked inside precipitates could be approximated. It was shown that even with a Cu content close to impurity levels, the Al-Mg-Si system precipitation was significantly affected with overageing. The principal change was due to a gradually increasing phase fraction of the Cu-containing Q'-phase, which eventually was seen to dominate the precipitate structures. The structural overtake could be explained based on a continuous formation of the thermally stable Q'-phase, with Cu atomic columns incorporating less Cu than what could potentially be accommodated.},

	abstract = {Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-{STEM}) of local atomic diffraction patterns is emerging as a powerful technique for probing intricate details of atomic structure and atomic electric fields. However, efficient processing and interpretation of large volumes of data remain challenging, especially for two-dimensional or light materials because the diffraction signal recorded on the pixelated arrays is weak. Here we employ data-driven manifold leaning approaches for straightforward visualization and exploration analysis of 4D-{STEM} datasets, distilling real-space neighboring effects on atomically resolved deflection patterns from single-layer graphene, with single dopant atoms, as recorded on a pixelated detector. These extracted patterns relate to both individual atom sites and sublattice structures, effectively discriminating single dopant anomalies via multi-mode views. We believe manifold learning analysis will accelerate physics discoveries coupled between data-rich imaging mechanisms and materials such as ferroelectric, topological spin, and van der Waals heterostructures. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign},

By incoherently averaging these convergent beam electron diffraction patterns over many probe positions, a pattern develops that ceases to depend on lens aberrations and effective source size, but remains highly sensitive to specimen thickness, tilt, and polarity. Through a combination of experiment and simulation for a wide variety of materials, we demonstrate that these position averaged convergent beam electron diffraction patterns can be used to determine sample thicknesses (to better than 10\%), specimen tilts (to better than 1mrad) and sample polarity for the same electron optical conditions and sample thicknesses as used in atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging. These measurements can be carried out by visual comparison without the need to apply pattern-matching algorithms. The influence of thermal diffuse scattering on patterns is investigated by comparing the frozen phonon and absorptive model calculations. We demonstrate that the absorptive model is appropriate for measuring thickness and other specimen parameters even for relatively thick samples ({\textgreater}50nm).},

These 4D-{STEM} datasets are rich in information, including signatures of the local structure, orientation, deformation, electromagnetic fields, and other sample-dependent properties. However, extracting this information requires complex analysis pipelines that include data wrangling, calibration, analysis, and visualization, all while maintaining robustness against imaging distortions and artifacts.

These features hinder accurate automated computational detection and position measurement of the diffracted disks, limiting the precision of measurements of local deformation. Here, we investigate the use of patterned probes to improve the precision of strain mapping. We imprint a “bullseye” pattern onto the probe, by using a binary mask in the probe-forming aperture, to improve the robustness of the peak finding algorithm to intensity modulations inside the diffracted disks. We show that this imprinting leads to substantially improved strain-mapping precision at the expense of a slight decrease in spatial resolution. In experiments on an unstrained silicon reference sample, we observe an improvement in strain measurement precision from 2.7\% of the reciprocal lattice vectors with standard probes to 0.3\% using bullseye probes for a thin sample, and an improvement from 4.7\% to 0.8\% for a thick sample. We also use multislice simulations to explore how sample thickness and electron dose limit the attainable accuracy and precision for 4D-{STEM} strain measurements.},

Hydrogel-based biomaterials are well suited to mimic aspects of these in vivo environments, owing to their high water content, soft tissue-like elasticity, and often-tunable biochemical content. Further, hydrogels can be engineered to achieve changes in matrix properties over time to better mimic dynamic native microenvironments for probing and directing stem cell function and fate. This review will focus on techniques to form hydrogel-based biomaterials and modify their properties in time during cell culture using select addition reactions, cleavage reactions, or non-covalent interactions.

	abstract = {Automated experiments in 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) are implemented for rapid discovery of local structures, symmetry-breaking distortions, and internal electric and magnetic fields in complex materials. Deep kernel learning enables active learning of the relationship between local structure and 4D-{STEM}-based descriptors. With this, efficient and “intelligent” probing of dissimilar structural elements to discover desired physical functionality is made possible. This approach allows effective navigation of the sample in an automated fashion guided by either a predetermined physical phenomenon, such as strongest electric field magnitude, or in an exploratory fashion. We verify the approach first on preacquired 4D-{STEM} data and further implement it experimentally on an operational {STEM}. The experimental discovery workflow is demonstrated using graphene and subsequently extended toward a lesser-known layered 2D van der Waals material, {MnPS}3. This approach establishes a pathway for physics-driven automated 4D-{STEM} experiments that enable probing the physics of strongly correlated systems and quantum materials and devices, as well as exploration of beam-sensitive materials.},

	abstract = {, Although scanning transmission electron microscopy ({STEM}) images of individual heavy atoms were reported 50 years ago, the applications of atomic-resolution {STEM} imaging became wide spread only after the practical realization of aberration correctors on field-emission {STEM}/{TEM} instruments to form sub-Ångstrom electron probes. The innovative designs and advances of electron optical systems, the fundamental understanding of electron–specimen interaction processes, and the advances in detector technology all played a major role in achieving the goal of atomic-resolution {STEM} imaging of practical materials. It is clear that tremendous advances in computer technology and electronics, image acquisition and processing algorithms, image simulations, and precision machining synergistically made atomic-resolution {STEM} imaging routinely accessible. It is anticipated that further hardware/software development is needed to achieve three-dimensional atomic-resolution {STEM} imaging with single-atom chemical sensitivity, even for electron-beam-sensitive materials. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big-data science are expected to significantly enhance the impact of {STEM} and associated techniques on many research fields such as materials science and engineering, quantum and nanoscale science, physics and chemistry, and biology and medicine. This review focuses on advances of {STEM} imaging from the invention of the field-emission electron gun to the realization of aberration-corrected and monochromated atomic-resolution {STEM} and its broad applications.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in high-speed pixelated electron detectors have substantially facilitated the implementation of four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-{STEM}). A critical application of 4D-{STEM} is electron ptychography, which reveals the atomic structure of a specimen by reconstructing its transmission function from redundant convergent-beam electron diffraction patterns. Although 4D-{STEM} ptychography offers many advantages over conventional imaging modes, this emerging technique has not been fully applied to materials highly sensitive to electron beams. In this Outlook, we introduce the fundamentals of 4D-{STEM} ptychography, focusing on data collection and processing methods, and present the current applications of 4D-{STEM} ptychography in various materials. Next, we discuss the potential advantages of imaging electron-beam-sensitive materials using 4D-{STEM} ptychography and explore its feasibility by performing simulations and experiments on a zeolite material. The preliminary results demonstrate that, at the low electron dose required to preserve the zeolite structure, 4D-{STEM} ptychography can reliably provide higher resolution and greater tolerance to the specimen thickness and probe defocus as compared to existing imaging techniques. In the final section, we discuss the challenges and possible strategies to further reduce the electron dose for 4D-{STEM} ptychography. If successful, it will be a game-changer for imaging extremely sensitive materials, such as metal–organic frameworks, hybrid halide perovskites, and supramolecular crystals.},

	abstract = {{ConspectusScanning} electron nanobeam diffraction, or 4D-{STEM} (four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy), is a flexible and powerful approach to elucidate structure from “soft” materials that are challenging to image in the transmission electron microscope because their structure is easily damaged by the electron beam. In a 4D-{STEM} experiment, a converged electron beam is scanned across the sample, and a pixelated camera records a diffraction pattern at each scan position. This four-dimensional data set can be mined for various analyses, producing maps of local crystal orientation, structural distortions, crystallinity, or different structural classes. Holding the sample at cryogenic temperatures minimizes diffusion of radicals and the resulting damage and disorder caused by the electron beam. The total fluence of incident electrons can easily be controlled during 4D-{STEM} experiments by careful use of the beam blanker, steering of the localized electron dose, and by minimizing the fluence in the convergent beam thus minimizing beam damage. This technique can be applied to both organic and inorganic materials that are known to be beam-sensitive; they can be highly crystalline, semicrystalline, mixed phase, or amorphous.One common example is the case for many organic materials that have a π–π stacking of polymer chains or rings on the order of 3.4–4.2 Å separation. If these chains or rings are aligned in some regions, they will produce distinct diffraction spots (as would other crystalline spacings in this range), though they may be weak or diffuse for disordered or weakly scattering materials. We can reconstruct the orientation of the π–π stacking, the degree of π–π stacking in the sample, and the domain size of the aligned regions. This Account summarizes illumination conditions and experimental parameters for 4D-{STEM} experiments with the goal of producing images of structural features for materials that are beam-sensitive. We will discuss experimental parameters including sample cooling, probe size and shape, fluence, and cameras. 4D-{STEM} has been applied to a variety of materials, not only as an advanced technique for model systems, but as a technique for the beginning microscopist to answer materials science questions. It is noteworthy that the experimental data acquisition does not require an aberration-corrected {TEM} but can be produced on a variety of instruments with the right attention to experimental parameters.},
